    Jednou z otázek v strukturální teorii tuhosti (Rigidity Theory)
    je, zda realizace vrcholů grafu do roviny je pohyblivá,
    tj.~zda umožňuje spojitou deformaci neměnící délku hran.
    %
    Pohyblivá realizace souvislého grafu v rovině existuje právě tehdy, když
    graf má NAC-obarvení, což je hranové obarvení dvěma barvami takové,
    že pro každý cyklus jsou všechny hrany obarveny stejnou barvou, nebo
    jsou každou barvou obarveny alespoň dvě hrany.
    %
    Je NP-úplné rozhodnout, zda graf má NAC-obarvení, v práci ukazujeme,
    že problém je NP-úplný i pro grafy s maximálním stupněm pět.
    %
    Představujeme značně rychlejší algoritmus i s jeho implementací
    na hledání NAC-obarvení společně s různými heuristikami.
    Srovnáváme ho s předchozími algoritmy a porovnáváme i heuristiky mezi sebou.
    %
    Následně představujeme FPT algoritmus na počítání NAC-obarvení
    parametrizovaný stromovou šířkou.
    %
    Navíc popisujeme vztahy se stabilními řezy grafu a implementujeme algoritmus
    pro jejich hledání v flexible grafech.
}
% Also update README.md if any changes are made.
\ctufitabstractENG{
    One of the questions in Rigidity Theory is whether a realization of the
    vertices of a graph in the plane is flexible, namely, if it allows a continuous
    deformation preserving the edge lengths.
    %
    A flexible realization of a connected graph in the plane exists if and only if
    the graph has a NAC-coloring, which is surjective edge coloring by
    two colors such that for each cycle either all the edges have the same color or
    there are at least two edges of each color.
    %
    While it is known that it is \mbox{NP-complete}
    to decide if a graph has a NAC-coloring,
    we show that the problem is
    also NP-complete for graphs with maximum degree five.
    %
    We present a significantly faster algorithm with an implementation for NAC-coloring search,
    and we discuss related heuristics.
    The performance is compared with previous algorithms and among the heuristics.
    %
    We also present fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm for NAC-coloring counting
    parametrized by treewidth.
    %
    We discuss relation to stable cuts and an algorithm for finding
    a stable cut is implemented as part of the thesis.

	%
	I also want to especially thank Jaromír Cimrman
	for his significant influence on science as we know it
	and Apakrychle for watching over me.
