\begin{chapterabstract}

	In this chapter,
	we evaluate performance of the algorithms
	proposed in \Cref{chapter:algo}.
	First, we compare the high-level approaches with previous approaches and among each other,
	and then we compare heuristics with each other
	for different  graph classes.
	We show reduction both in runtime and in the number
	of \IsNACColoring{} checks performed.
	Lastly, we evaluate the strategies and
	recommend ones that should be merged into PyRigi.

\end{chapterabstract}

In this section we first set meaningful targets for our benchmarks,
then we compare the performance of our algorithms with the previous implementation
and show running time and internal search optimizations for various graph classes.

The main question regarding NAC-coloring search is whether a graph has a NAC-coloring.
We usually ask the algorithm to not only answer yes, but to also provide a certificate.
%
For flexible graphs, it is algorithmically quite simple to find a NAC-coloring,
so this question is more interesting for rigid graphs.
%
For flexible graphs, it is more interesting to ask for the number of NAC-colorings
of a graph.
Note, that for larger flexible graphs with around thirty vertices
the number of NAC-colorings is huge as it often grows exponentially.
This slows our algorithm down as just materializing and iterating exponential
number of NAC-colorings takes exponential time.
%
For such cases, the FPT algorithm described in \Cref{chapter:fpt}
could be a better fit as it does not materialize any NAC-colorings,
but implementing it is out of the scope of this thesis.

The graphs the algorithm works with have integer vertices (we relabel the otherwise).
We noticed that for synthetically generated graphs,
the algorithm performs slightly better compared to
the same algorithm run on the same graph with vertices randomly relabeled.
To counteract this, we tried to relabel the graphs using BFS,
but we reached no performance gains compared to the random relabeling.

Visualizations in the following sections were created by grouping data per dataset,
graph size and some specified attribute --- usually the strategies used.
%
We show mean of the running time in milliseconds or
the number of \IsNACColoring{} calls.
%
Graphs with median and third quartile can be seen in \texttt{NAC\_presentation.ipynb}.


\section{Improvement over previous solutions}

The benchmarks comparing our algorithm with the previous implementations
were run on Linux on a laptop with Intel i7 of the 11th generation
with CPython 3.12~\cite{cpython} and SageMath 10.4~\cite{sagemath}.
The remaining benchmarks were run a laptop with Intel i5 of the 6th generation
using CPython 3.12.
On more modern hardware, the running times could be significantly shorter.

\Cref{tab:all_min_rigid}
shows the time required for finding all the NAC-colorings
of all minimally rigid graphs with given vertex count.
%
They are generated using Nauty~\cite{nauty}
with a corresponding plugin~\cite{nauty_plugin}.
%
We show results of the implementation
in \flexrilog{}~\cite{flexrilog} using \trcon{} components
run in SageMath~\cite{sagemath}
and compare them to our implementation of the same \Naive{} algorithm
using $\triangle$-connected components
and monochromatic classes as described in \Cref{sec:NACvalid}.
Next column shows \NaiveCycles{} from \Cref{sec:small_cycles}
using monochromatic classes.
The last column is for the \NeighborsDegree{} (each initial subgraph has $k=4$ monochromatic classes)
with \MergeLinear{} merging strategy.
%
In every case, our algorithms are significantly faster than implementation in \flexrilog{}~\cite{flexrilog}.
Notice also huge advantage gained by using monochromatic classes instead of \trcon{} components.

\Cref{fig:graph_time_minimally_rigid}
shows timings to compute all NAC-colorings of minimally rigid graphs
depending on the strategy used.
We did not list all NAC-colorings for all minimally rigid graphs with twelve vertices and more
as there are too many such graphs (around 44 millions for twelve vertices).
%
We rather randomly generated dataset of minimally rigid graphs
using NetworkX~\cite{networkx} and PyRigi~\cite{pyrigi}.
%
It can be seen that for graphs up to around fourteen vertices the \NaiveCycles{} algorithm
is still faster than \Subgraphs{}.
For graphs with more than eighteen vertices,
the growing advantage of \Subgraphs{} is already clear.
\Subgraphs{} algorithm can list all NAC-colorings on graphs with 30 monochromatic classes
usually in a few seconds.
This corresponds to \( 2^{29} \) checks done by \NaiveCycles{}.

	\caption[Running time for minimally rigid graphs]{
		Mean running time to find all NAC-colorings for minimally rigid graphs.}%
	\label{fig:graph_time_minimally_rigid}
\end{figure}%

If we analyze the number of \IsNACColoring{} calls performed by \NaiveCycles{} and \Subgraphs{} algorithms
as shown in \Cref{fig:graph_count_minimally_rigid},
it can be seen that the number of \IsNACColoring{} calls is reduced already for graphs
with eleven vertices,
even though the \NaiveCycles{} algorithm is still faster for these graphs.
%
We think that the slowdown is caused by internal overhead
used for subgraphs splitting and merging.

		The number of checks performed to find all NAC-colorings for minimally rigid graphs.}%
	\label{fig:graph_count_minimally_rigid}
\end{figure}%

In \Cref{fig:graph_summary}
we show the relation between the number of \IsNACColoring{} checks that
would \Naive{} algorithm perform compared to our solution.
%
The numbers of checks are similar for graphs with few monochromatic classes
when we consider \NaiveCycles{} using monochromatic classes and \Subgraphs{}.
That explains why the \NaiveCycles{} algorithm outperformed
the \NeighborsDegree{} \& \MergeLinear{} strategies in \Cref{tab:all_min_rigid}. This should improve quickly for larger graphs.
We can also see how the use of \CycleMask{} routine
reduces the number of more expensive \IsNACColoring{} calls,
since these are called only when the small cycles check \CycleMask{} fails to decide
(\CycleMask{} is called every time).

\section{Performance on specific graph classes}%
\label{sec:bench_graph_classes}

Each benchmark was run two or three times and the mean was taken.
The graphs are grouped either by the number of vertices
monochromatic classes or \trcon{} components, see respective \(x\)-axis.
Overall, over 350k \emph{benchmarks runs}
(a graph of a graph class run with a splitting strategy, merging strategy
and target subgraph size)
are presented (and 200k more were run for strategies not worth mentioning)
on over 12.8k graphs from multiple graph classes.
%
There are six splitting strategies, eight merging strategies, and usually two target subgraph sizes.
There is also one more for \NaiveCycles{}.
Therefore, the whole heuristic state space has ninety-seven combinations,
and thus we could have run up to 1.2 million benchmark runs on our dataset.
We omitted many benchmark runs for strategies where we saw the  performance is poor.
%
We tested mostly only graphs with up to one hundred vertices
as it is computationally hard to find larger graphs in the classes given
and to run enough benchmarks for them.
A NAC-coloring can be found for these graphs
in hundreds of milliseconds or seconds at most.

First, we only show strategies that performed generally well,
we show the others later in \Cref{sec:other_strategies}.
If a configuration did not finish in the given time limit,
we replace the runtime field with the limit of the benchmark, usually 5 seconds.
These runs are excluded from figures with the number of check calls.


\subsection*{Minimally rigid graphs}

In the previous section, we showed performance of the algorithm for listing
all NAC-colorings of minimally rigid graphs,
but did not compare the strategies among each other.
%
\Neighbors{} and \NeighborsDegree{} perform slightly better than \None{} and
\SharedVertices{} outperforms \MergeLinear{} slightly.
The same also holds for the number of \IsNACColoring{} checks.
Notice that the runtime grows exponentially, but with lower factor than \NaiveCycles{}.
The growth is expected as the number of NAC-coloring grows fast.

In \Cref{fig:graph_minimally_rigid_first_runtime,fig:graph_minimally_rigid_first_checks}
we focus on finding some NAC-coloring of minimally rigid graphs.
%
Minimally rigid graphs have large number of NAC-colorings,
therefore it is simple for both \NaiveCycles{}
and \Subgraphs{} algorithms to find some NAC-coloring,
and it can be seen that for larger graphs, the required runtime
does not grow significantly.
%
Note that minimally rigid graphs have no NAC-coloring if and only if they are formed from
a single \trcon{} component (resp.\ they are a 2-tree, recall \Cref{lemma:stable_cut_or_2_tree}).
Therefore, such instances do not worsen runtime performance as they are resolved instantly.
%
\NaiveCycles{} is faster as it has lower internal overhead.
The number of \IsNACColoring{} checks is also lower,
that is probably because \Subgraphs{} strategies do additional checks
while merging, which are not needed for \NaiveCycles{}.
\SharedVertices{} behaves unpredictably while \MergeLinear{} is consistent
for both the runtime and the number of \IsNACColoring{} checks.

	\label{fig:graph_minimally_rigid_first_checks}
\end{figure}%



\subsection*{No three nor four cycle graphs}

From~\cite{extremal_graphs} we obtained all graphs with up to 52 vertices
that have no three nor four cycles. This class of graphs is interesting for us
as there cannot be any \trcon{} components.
These graphs have also many NAC-colorings.
Because of that, as seen in \Cref{fig:graph_count_no_3_nor_4_cycles_first_runtime},
\NaiveCycles{} is again faster for finding some NAC-coloring
for the similar reasons as for minimally rigid graphs.
%
Also notice that \SharedVertices{} performs worse and non-deterministically
for \CyclesMatchChunks{} and \None{}.
For \Neighbors{}, the performance is more stable, but still worse than \MergeLinear{}.

\begin{figure}[thbp]
	\centering
	\scalebox{\BenchFigureScale}{\input{./figures/graph_export_no_3_nor_4_cycles_first_monochromatic_runtime_split_merging_mean.pgf}}

% 		The number of checks performed to find some NAC-coloring for graphs with no three nor four cycles.}%
% 	\label{fig:graph_count_no_3_nor_4_cycles_first_checks}
% \end{figure}%

For listing all NAC-colorings shown
in \Cref{fig:graph_count_no_3_nor_4_cycles_all_runtime},
it can be seen that \NaiveCycles{} is almost never faster.
We can see that \None{} and \CyclesMatchChunks{} is also slower than
\Neighbors{} and \NeighborsDegree{}.
At around twenty-eight vertices five second time limit is reached for all algorithms.
\MergeLinear{} and \SharedVertices{} have no significant influence.

% \end{figure}%


\subsection*{Globally rigid graphs}

A random graph can be generated taking a graph with no edges on \( n \) vertices
and for each pair of vertices adding an edge with probability~\( p \).
This model is often referred to as Erdős-Rényi~\cite{random_gnp}.
%
John Haslegrave provided us with yet unpublished formula for \( p \)
such that a random graph generated with \( p \)
should probably have no or just a few NAC-colorings.
%
We instead used \( p' = 0.95\cdot p \) to generate random graphs that
should have small number of NAC-colorings.
For such random graphs, we checked if they are globally rigid using PyRigi~\cite{pyrigi}.
%
By doing this, we also randomly generated a dataset of globally rigid graphs
up to 57 vertices.
%
Note that there also exist globally rigid graphs
that are just one edge different from minimally rigid graphs.
These graphs are probably not included in our dataset.

The idea of monochromatic classes is so effective
that even large graphs collapse into just a few monochromatic classes.
Majority of the graphs in this dataset either has a NAC-coloring,
or only a single monochromatic class and therefore no NAC-coloring.
In our dataset, 75 percent of graphs have less than ten	monochromatic classes,
but only 10 percent of graphs have less than ten \trcon{} components
as you can see in \Cref{fig:monochrom_vs_triangle_globally_rigid}.
For minimally rigid graphs, this is not the case as expected, see
\Cref{fig:monochrom_vs_triangle_minimally_rigid}.

	\label{fig:monochrom_vs_triangle}
\end{figure}

\NaiveCycles{} is no longer faster for finding a NAC-coloring
as shown in \Cref{fig:graph_globally_rigid_first_runtime}.
\None{} and \Neighbors{} strategies match the performance and
the other are not far behind.

\NaiveCycles{} algorithm is significantly slower when we list all NAC-colorings
as expected, see \Cref{fig:graph_globally_rigid_all_runtime}.
\None{} and \CycleMask{} strategies also lack behind \Neighbors{} and \NeighborsDegree{}.
We do not see an advantage of \MergeLinear{} over \SharedVertices{} anymore.
%
It can be also seen in \Cref{fig:graph_globally_rigid_all_checks}
that for the number of checks performed the same statements hold.

\section{Performance on graphs with no NAC-colorings}

In the previous section, the \Subgraphs{} algorithm
often performed worse considering runtime.
As explained, it is caused by the graphs being too simple
--- having plenty of NAC-colorings.
%
For many NP-complete problems, studied instances are often
those where there are only few or no solutions.
In this section, we focus on graphs with no NAC-colorings.

We searched for random graphs where \( |E| \ge 2|V(G)| - 2 \) that have
multiple monochromatic classes, but no NAC-coloring%
\nohznamka{
	We could have also used the same formula as for globally rigid graphs.
}.
%
As this graph generation was slow, we searched only for
graphs with more than \( 2\sqrt{|V(G)|} \) \trcon{} components.
%
This once again shows how effective monochromatic classes are
in comparison with \trcon{} components.
We generated and tested five thousand of such graphs from 40 to 130 vertices in size.
Just one of them had more than one monochromatic class.
%
The following benchmarks are run with monochromatic classes disabled,
\trcon{} components are used instead.

For these graphs, \NaiveCycles{} algorithm needs to traverse all \( 2^{t-1} \) \(\red\)-\(\blue\)-colorings
where \( t \) is the number of \trcon{} components. It can be clearly seen that
this is not suitable for graphs as large as we use in this benchmark,
therefore, they are not present as they did not finish in reasonable time.
It can be seen from \Cref{fig:graph_no_nac_coloring_first_runtime}
that \SharedVertices{} is faster than \MergeLinear{},
for runtime and also for the number of checks performed
as shown in \Cref{fig:graph_no_nac_coloring_first_checks}.
%
It can be also seen that \NeighborsDegree{} strategy is
faster than the other strategies, and it holds for both merging strategies.
Also notice that,
runtime grows strictly exponentially.
This is in contrast with the previous section
as these graphs are not simple anymore.

	\label{fig:graph_no_nac_coloring_first_checks}
\end{figure}%

In \Subgraphs{} algorithm description, an important parameter was the size of subgraphs \( k \).
Majority of the benchmarks in the previous section were run with \( k = 4 \).
%
We show the impact of	\( k \) on runtime and number of checks.
Note that you see averages over all the strategies used for benchmarking
graphs with no NAC-colorings.
%
From graphs in \Cref{fig:graph_no_nac_coloring_first_runtime_subgraph_size,fig:graph_no_nac_coloring_first_checks_subgraph_size},
it can be seen that the number of checks is reduced for smaller \( k \).
On the other hand, the runtime improves slightly for larger \( k \)
and the difference between strategies becomes negligible for larger graphs.

\section{Other strategies}%
\label{sec:other_strategies}

In this section, we show the performance of other strategies described in \Cref{chapter:algo}.
We do not show these strategies in previous figures as they would influence
the scale and would make figures and legends unreadable and unclear.

Some of these strategies perform as well as
than our preferred strategies for some graph classes,
but fail for others and therefore are not universal enough to use in a library.
%
In the following figures, we fixed
split strategy to \Neighbors{} or merging strategy to \MergeLinear{}
as they perform the best as shown in \Cref{sec:bench_graph_classes}.

First, we show in \Cref{fig:graph_mimimally_rigid_failing_merging_first_runtime,fig:graph_no_nac_coloring_generated_rigid_failing_merging_first_runtime}
how strategies like \Log{} and \PromisingCycles{} fail on minimally rigid graphs.
We also shown in \Cref{fig:graph_mimimally_rigid_failing_split_first_runtime},
\KernighanLin{} and \Cuts{} perform worse.
%
Graphs with no three nor four cycles behave similarly for these strategies.
%

	\label{fig:graph_mimimally_rigid_failing_split_first_runtime}
\end{figure}%


As shown in \Cref{fig:graph_no_nac_coloring_generated_rigid_failing_merging_first_runtime},
strategies \Log{}, \SortedBits{} and \MinMax{} fail,
\PromisingCycles{} perform well on the other hand.
%
It can be seen that strategies \SortedSize{} and \Score{} perform
as well as our preferred strategies on graphs with no NAC-coloring.
But as they must list all the NAC-colorings on each subgraph,
they are not suitable for cases where only one NAC-coloring is requested.
%
In \Cref{fig:graph_no_nac_coloring_generated_rigid_failing_split_first_runtime}
it can be seen that performance of \KernighanLin{} and \Cuts{} is worse.

Smart split described in \Cref{sec:smart_split}
did not improve the runtime.
We expected minor performance hit for smaller graphs because heuristic is run
multiple times, but gains for larger graphs where subgraphs merging order
should join subgraphs near to each other together. This is not the case.

\section{Final comparison}

Based on our benchmarks, most of which we presented in the previous sections,
we evaluate respective strategies and choose ones
that should we recommend are kept and merged into PyRigi.
%
For graph classes with a lot of NAC-colorings,
\NaiveCycles{} is usually the best choice
when we search for a single NAC-coloring.
%
The user of the library has to pay attention while using this strategy
as if there is just a few or no NAC-coloring and the graph does not trivially collapse
into few monochromatic classes, the runtime is huge.
Therefore, \NaiveCycles{} should be an available option in PyRigi,
but the default algorithm should be based on \Subgraphs{}.

First we evaluate strategies for splitting:
Strategy \None{} works well in most of the cases and for simple
instances it outperforms other strategies as it requires little to no overhead.
%
\CyclesMatchChunks{} perform well in the majority cases similar to \None{},
but it is generally outperformed by \Neighbors{}.
%
\Neighbors{} and \NeighborsDegree{} generally managed to reduce the number
of \IsNACColoring{} calls and for complex cases they often
perform slightly better then \None{}, usually for more complex instances.
Note that the implementation of \Neighbors{} is slightly simpler than
the one of \NeighborsDegree{}.
%
\KernighanLin{} results are not consistent.
\Cuts{} perform even worse for even small instance.
This is probably because they operate on a graph of monochromatic
components that does not preserve all the properties
of the original graph well.
They were never noticeably faster than \Neighbors{}.
Therefore, these algorithms cannot be used in general case.
%
Based on this evaluation, we recommend strategies \None{} and \Neighbors{}
as they perform the best across all graph classes and
as \Neighbors{} strategy has simpler implementation than \NeighborsDegree{}.

\MergeLinear{} strategy performed the best across the board.
It seems that the idea of merging one growing subgraph
with subgraphs of initial small size works the best
in a general case.
%
For listing all NAC-colorings, \SharedVertices{} performs
slightly better, but for a search for a single NAC-coloring for simple instances,
its runtime becomes less predictable.
%
From the general idea of the \Subgraphs{} algorithm,
it makes a lot of sense \Log{} strategy would work great.
This is not the case as \Log{} is slow for all the cases we tested.
%
\MinMax{} and \SortedBits{} strategies often perform badly
and if they do not, they do not outperform other strategies.
%
\PromisingCycles{} performs similarly well as \Neighbors{}
for graphs with no NAC-coloring,
but fails for simple instances which makes it not universal enough.
%
\SortedSize{} and \Score{} also perform well for graphs with no NAC-coloring,
but as explained in \Cref{sec:merging},
they are unsuitable for instances where only a single NAC-coloring
should be found as these strategies always list all NAC-colorings
on all subgraphs.
%
Based on this evaluation, we recommend strategy \MergeLinear{} as a general good choice.
We also recommend \SharedVertices{} for graphs that are not simple instances.
