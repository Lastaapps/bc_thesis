	abstract = { A k-tree is a graph that can be reduced to the k-complete graph
	            by a sequence of removals of a degree k vertex with completely
	            connected neighbors. We address the problem of determining whether
	            a graph is a partial graph of a k-tree. This problem is motivated
	            by the existence of polynomial time algorithms for many
	            combinatorial problems on graphs when the graph is constrained to
	            be a partial k-tree for fixed k. These algorithms have practical
	            applications in areas such as reliability, concurrent broadcasting
	            and evaluation of queries in a relational database system. We
	            determine the complexity status of two problems related to finding
	            the smallest number k such that a given graph is a partial k-tree.
	            First, the corresponding decision problem is NP-complete. Second,
	            for a fixed (predetermined) value of k, we present an algorithm
	            with polynomially bounded (but exponential in k) worst case time
	            complexity. Previously, this problem had only been solved for \$k =
	            1,2,3\$. },
