\chapter{NP-completeness on graphs with maximal degree five}%
\label{chapter:NP}

\begin{chapterabstract}

	It has been already shown that it is NP-complete to decide
	if a graph has a NAC-coloring.
	One could hope that for graphs with small maximal degree
	the problem becomes somewhat simpler.
	In this chapter we show that this is not the case
	for graphs with maximal degree five --- the problem is still NP-complete.
	A graph is constructed from gadgets and equivalence
	with NAC-coloring existence and 3-SAT is proved.

\end{chapterabstract}

In this section we prove that the question
whether a NAC-coloring exists is NP-complete on the class of graphs with maximum
degree five and also on the class of graphs with average degree smaller
than $4+\varepsilon$ of any $\varepsilon >0$.
We proceed by reduction from the 3-SAT problem,
namely, the question if a boolean formula
in conjunctive normal form in which each clause contains exactly three literals is satisfiable.
The main idea of our proof is inspired by
the proof of NAC-coloring NP-completeness~\cite{np_complete}.
We propose a different gadget construction that allows us to limit the maximum
degree in the constructed graph.

\begin{theorem}%
	\label{theorem:nac-deg-5}
	%
	The question whether a graph has a NAC-coloring is NP-complete
	on the class of graphs with maximum degree five.
	%
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	%
	Let $\phi$ be a formula with variables $x_{1}, \dots, x_{n}$
	and clauses $L_1, \dots, L_k$.
	Our goal is to construct a graph $G_\phi$
	of size $O(n+k)$ such that $\phi$ is satisfiable if and only if
	$G_\phi$ has a NAC-coloring.

	We exploit the fact that \trcon{} components
	are monochromatic in every NAC-coloring.
	In particular, every subgraph isomorphic to a ladder graph with diagonals is monochromatic.
	We call a ladder graph such that every 4-cycle has one diagonal a \emph{braced ladder}.
	We build a 2-tree structure called a \emph{train},
	which is a ``horizontal'' braced ladder with other ``vertical'' braced ladders
	glued so that the maximum degree is 5, see \Cref{fig:proof_trains}.
	A train can be extended arbitrarily to connect more braced ladders.

	We label the edges of $G_\phi$ with literals $x_i, \bar{x}_i$,
	where the bar denotes negation, for $1 \le i \le n$ and with $t, f$ literals.
	The edges in one \trcon{} component have always the same label.
	We construct the graph so that the edges with the same label
	have the same color in every NAC-coloring:
	eventually, blue edges will correspond to \true{} and red edges to \false{}.

	We take $2n+2$ trains, the edges of each labelled by one literal, to which we will
	link other gadgets using braced ladders.
	Note that an edge of a graph such that its end vertices have degrees at most 3 and 4,
	can be glued to a train via a braced ladder so that the maximum degree is at most 5.

	For each variable $x_i$, we create two gadgets:
	one with cycle $A_i$ in the center
	with the edges of the cycle linked using braced ladders
	to the trains $x_i, \bar{x}_i$ and $t$
	and the other linked to the trains $x_i, \bar{x}_i, t$ and $f$
	according to \Cref{fig:proof_enforce_true_false}.

	For each clause $L_i$, we create a gadget indicated

	Let $\hat{x}_{i,1}, \hat{x}_{i,2}, \hat{x}_{i,3}$
	be literals used in $L_i$
	where $\hat{x}_{i,j}$ denotes either $x_{i,j}$ or $\bar{x}_{i,j}$

	to the appropriate literal trains.
	Since each of the 3-prism subgraphs has only one NAC-coloring up to swapping colors,
	all edges labelled with the same label have the same color in every NAC-coloring.

	\end{figure}

	Note that for the variable gadgets we add
	a fixed number of vertices and edges bounded by $O(n)$ and
	for the clause gadgets the number is bounded by $O(k)$.
	Therefore, the whole graph size is bounded by $O(n+k)$
	and the graph can be constructed in polynomial time.
	Also, note that the maximum degree is five.

	We prove that the graph $G_\phi$ has a NAC-coloring if and only if
	$\phi$ is satisfiable.
	Suppose we first have a NAC-coloring $\delta$ of $G_\phi$.
	Let the train $t$ be blue.
	We derive some properties of the NAC-coloring from the graph.
	We prove that the trains $x_i$ and~$\bar{x}_i$
	are colored with different colors for every $i$
	and the train $f$ is red.

	Assume for contradiction that the train $f$ is blue.
	Then the trains $x_i$ and $\bar{x}_i$ have the same color for all $i$,
	otherwise $B_i$ would form an almost cycle.
	Since every edge is labelled by a literal and NAC-coloring is surjective,
	there is literal $x_j$ such that the trains~$x_j$ and~$\bar{x}_j$ are red.
	But then the cycle $A_j$ is an almost cycle, which is a contradiction.
	Hence, the train $f$ is red.
	From the cycles $B_i$ we also see
	that trains $x_i$ and $\bar{x}_i$ have to be colored with different colors
	for every $i$.

	Now we create the related truth assignment.
	For each variable $x_i$ we assign \true{} if
	the train $x_i$ is blue,
	otherwise \false{}.
	Each cause $L_i$ is satisfied since
	in every cycle $C_i$, at least one of
	the literals $\hat{x}_{i,j}$ corresponds to blue colored
	edges, otherwise an almost red cycle is formed.
	Therefore, a truth assignment for $\phi$ can be obtained
	from a NAC-coloring of~$G_\phi$ in polynomial time.

	Now we prove that for every truth assignment such that $\phi$ evaluates to \true{}, there exist
	a NAC-coloring of $G_\phi$. We define an edge coloring
	$\delta: E(G_\phi) \to \{\red, \blue\}$ as follows:
	the edges labelled with $t$ and $f$ are blue and red respectively,
	and an edge labelled by literals $x_i$, resp.\ $\bar{x}_i$, is blue
	if $x_i$, resp.\ $\bar{x}_i$, evaluates to \true{} in the truth assignment, red otherwise.
	Since $t$ and $f$ have different colors,
	the coloring $\delta$ is surjective.

	Suppose there is an almost cycle $C$.
	Let $e=uv$ be the edge of the almost cycle $C$ that has the opposite color
	than all the other edges of $C$.
	The vertices $u$ and $v$ must be contained in multiple \trcon{} components
	since these are monochromatic.
	In the gadgets, all such possibilities for $e$ are indicated by edges with yellow end vertices.
	The edge~$e$ cannot be in any train since there are no two adjacent vertices that are also
	in some other \trcon{} component.

	Now we use the fact that both $u$ and $v$ must be incident to edges of both colors.
	The gadget in \Cref{fig:proof_enforce_true_false} with cycle $A_i$
	cannot contain $e$ since exactly one of the two yellow vertices is incident only to blue edges
	as either $x_i$ or $\bar{x}_i$ are colored blue.
	The edge $e$ is not in the gadget with cycle $B_i$ either,
	since there is a pair of opposite vertices of the cycle $B_i$
	such that one vertex is incident only to blue edges and the other one only to red ones
	as $x_i$ is blue and $\bar{x}_i$ is red, or the other way around.

	For the third gadget in \Cref{fig:proof_clause},
	suppose first that $e$ is the edge in cycle $C_i$ labelled $t$.
	Since it is blue, the edges labelled $\hat{x}_{i,1}$ and $\hat{x}_{i,3}$ are red.
	The edges labelled $\hat{x}_{i,2}$ are blue since the $i$-th  clause evaluates to \true{}.
	Hence, nor $C_i$ nor any other cycle inside the gadget is an almost red cycle.
	Since every cycle containing $e$ that does not lie entirely in the gadget
	has to pass through some of the 3-prism subgraphs in the gadget, it contains another blue edge labelled by $t$.
	Analogous argument applies also for $e$ being any other edge in the gadget labelled by $t$.
	It remains to consider when $e$ is one of the edges in a 3-cycle of the 3-prism subgraphs.
	But in this case $C$ cannot be an almost cycle either since both triangles in each 3-prism are colored the same.

\begin{theorem}%
	\label{theorem:nac-eps}
	%
	For every $\varepsilon>0$,
	the question whether a NAC-coloring exists is NP-complete for graphs with $|E(G)| \leq (2 + \varepsilon) |V(G)|$.
	%
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	%
	Fix $\varepsilon>0$. We can assume $\varepsilon<\frac{1}{2}$.
	The proof of \Cref{theorem:nac-deg-5} applies once we show that
	we can create graph~$G'_\phi$ from the graph $G_\phi$ constructed for a formula $\phi$
	such that $|E(G'_\phi)| \leq (2 + \varepsilon) |V(G'_\phi)|$, and
	the graph $G'_\phi$ has a NAC-coloring if and only if $G_\phi$ has a NAC-coloring.
	We take any braced ladder in a train of $G_\phi$
	and extend it $k$-times as indicated in \Cref{fig:proof_trains}.
	Hence, $|E(G'_\phi)| = |E(G_\phi)|+4k$ and $|V(G'_\phi)| = |V(G_\phi)|+2k$.
	Since we modify only a \trcon{} component,
	there is a bijection between NAC-colorings of $G'_\phi$ and $G_\phi$.
	Using the fact that the maximum degree of $G_\phi$ is 5,
	the required inequality holds for any  $k\geq\left\lceil V\frac{1-2\varepsilon}{4\varepsilon}\right\rceil$.
